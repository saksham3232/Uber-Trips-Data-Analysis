# Uber Trips Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis and visualization project aimed at uncovering insights from Uber trip data using Python. The project leverages Python libraries to process, analyze, and visualize the data to help answer key questions about trip trends, performance, and customer behavior.

---

## Objectives

Through this analysis, we aim to answer the following key questions:

- **Trip Metrics**:
  - How many trips were taken?
  - How many trips were completed versus canceled?

- **Location Insights**:
  - Where did most of the pickups and drop-offs occur?

- **Product Analysis**:
  - What type of product (e.g., UberX, UberBlack) is most frequently selected?

- **Fare and Distance Metrics**:
  - What are the measures for fare, distance, amount, and time spent on rides?

- **Day/Time Trends**:
  - Which days of the week have the highest fares?
  - What is the average lead time before requesting a trip?

- **Ride Extremes**:
  - Which rides were the longest/shortest and most expensive/cheapest?

## Project Implementation

The project is implemented using **Python 3**. The following frameworks and libraries are utilized:

1. **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Seaborn**: Visualization for statistical graphics.
3. **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive visualization library.
